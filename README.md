Hi! I'm dhurg4.

I made this C Contact Management List to practice my C skills.

Here are the functionalities of the program:
1. Add a contact
2. View all contacts
3. Delete all contacts and exit

There aren't many features for now, and I would like to update the program to use structs and pointers more efficiently, however I need to practice a little more.

Thank you for viewing!
